# OSINT Automation Script

## Overview
This script automates the process of gathering Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) by leveraging various tools such as `theHarvester`, `sublist3r`, `whois`, and `nmap`. It provides a streamlined method for reconnaissance and enumeration on a target domain.

## Features
- Harvests email addresses and subdomains from public sources.
- Performs WHOIS lookup to gather domain registration details.
- Scans open ports using Nmap for potential vulnerabilities.
- Hosts a simple HTTP server to serve collected results.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- `theHarvester`
- `sublist3r`
- `whois`
- `nmap`
- `SimpleHTTPServer` (built-in with Python 2) or `http.server` (Python 3)

You can install the necessary Python packages using:
```sh
pip install theHarvester sublist3r
```

Make sure `whois` and `nmap` are installed on your system:
```sh
sudo apt install whois nmap
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/osint-automation.git
cd osint-automation
```
2. Ensure the script has execution permissions:
```sh
chmod +x osint_script.py
```

## Usage
Run the script with:
```sh
python3 osint_script.py <target_domain>
```
Replace `<target_domain>` with the actual domain you want to analyze.

### Example:
```sh
python3 osint_script.py example.com
```

To start the HTTP server and serve the results:
```sh
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
Access it via: `http://localhost:8080`

## Output
The script generates output in text format containing:
- Emails found
- Subdomains discovered
- WHOIS information
- Open ports and services
